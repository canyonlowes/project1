Our project is a Poker game. It starts off by asking you to enter a name
that you want to go by in the game, and place a bet or fold depending on the cards that you have dealt to you and the 'community cards' aka cards that are for the computer and yourself. To play, run the program, enter a valid username (containing no spaces and between 1 and 10 characters), and hit play! You will then be brought to the "pre_bet" page, where you can either go back to the home screen, or press deal when you're ready. From there, you will be dealt two cards, and one community card will be shown, enter a bet and press the bet button. Repeat this process until you get to the end of the game, where the dealer(computers) card are shown. You will either win or loose money depending on if you won or lost. From there, you can either play again or return to the home screen. Back in the home screen, you can change your settings including enableing/disableing full screen, and change the game background. You can also quit the game and view the game credits within the home page as well.
