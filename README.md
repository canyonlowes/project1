TODO

add cards to player and computer
make interface look nice with .grid for cards
figure out why turn is not checking the value entered

canyons thoughts:
Add credits/attributions for background images and other images used
should we color text boxes and buttons based off the selected backgrounds/themes?
background audio? - Maybe Look in to this after project is finished and we have time
